# LLM Law Research Prompts & Intents Repository

This repository contains a curated and structured library of prompts and user intents designed to maximize the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in legal research applications. It serves as a foundation for building intelligent law research assistants, like Harvey.ai, leveraging Google's Gemini or other advanced LLMs.

## Overview

Legal research using LLMs depends heavily on well-engineered prompts that reflect precise user intents. This repo organizes:

- **Prompt templates:** Tailored inputs for various legal research tasks such as case summarization, issue spotting, statutory interpretation, contract analysis, and more.

- **User intents:** Categorized descriptions of common legal research queries and objectives, helping classify and route questions to the appropriate prompt or LLM pipeline.

This modular approach enables customization, improves retrieval-augmented generation workflows, and facilitates experiment reproducibility.

## Goals

- Provide reusable, high-quality prompt examples for different legal domains and jurisdictions.
- Map user research intents to specific prompt structures for reliable output.
- Reduce trial-and-error in prompt engineering for legal LLM applications.
- Support multi-lingual and multi-jurisdictional considerations.
- Enable integration into automated legal research assistants and chatbot workflows.

## Repository Structure

- `/prompts` - Contains prompt templates with detailed instructions and examples.
- `/intents` - Defines user intents with metadata and mapping to prompts.
- `/Data` - Supplemental datasets like research intent spreadsheets.
- `/examples` - Sample queries and LLM responses to illustrate proper use.

## Usage

Users can adapt or extend prompt templates to fit domain-specific needs. Intents can be refined to improve classification and retrieval pipelines. The repository is designed for legal AI researchers, developers, and law professionals deploying LLM-powered research tools.
